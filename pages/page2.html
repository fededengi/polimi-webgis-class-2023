            Once the first susceptibility map is created, we need to
            <b>validate</b> the result. In order to do so, a validation script
            through R is performed. To run the script, we need to
            <b>reclassify</b> the susceptibility map layer into 2 simple
            classes, 0 and 1. All the pixels falling in the 0 - 0.5 range will
            be a 0, which means no hazard, while all those falling in the 0.5 -
            1 range will be a 1, so hazard. The process compares this new layer
            with the <b>testing</b> points layer that was created earlier and
            returns an accuracy level.

            The overall accuracy is <b>0.73</b>, a pretty low value that can be
            increased. In order to do so, we can try to <b>increase</b> the
            number of <b>training</b> points that are used to create the
            susceptibility map, so that the level of detail of the information
            will be higher.

          <p class="justify">
            The first attempt is to increase the overall number of points from
            1,000 to 2,000, keeping the 30:70 ratio, so that the
            <b>training</b> points will be <b>1,400</b> and the
            <b>testing</b> points <b>600</b>. We run the script again and then
            validate the result.

          <p class="justify">
            The overall accuracy is increased by 0.1 points till <b>0.83</b>,
            which seems a way better result, considering it's enough above 0.8
            and had a huge jump in relation to the 1,000 points version. Some
            possible explanations for this big change will be discussed later on
            in this section.

            The last step is to <b>assess</b> how many elements of the territory
            are <b>exposed</b> to the landslide susceptibility levels we just
            obtained. A first element to evaluate is how much of the
            <b>population</b> is exposed. The raster data of 2020 population
            aggregate according to the four classes returns these results.

          <p class="justify">
            Since both the 1,000 and 2,000 point layers results are presented,
            we can visualize how the values change in the two versions. In
            particular, it seems that in the second version the amount of people
            living in the "Low" class increases. This is mainly related to how
            the 2,000 points version represents the densely urbanized area of
            Aprica.

            <h4>Buildings assessment</h4>
          </header>
          <p class="justify">
            A second element that has been assessed is the presence of
            <b>buildings</b> in the four classes. The workflow is slightly
            different since the buildings layer of
            <i>Geoportale Regione Lombardia</i> is a vector dataset. For this
            reason, as a rule, it was considered the <b>highest</b> level of
            lanslide susceptibility on which each geometry was located and then
            the statistics on the buildings layer were computed.
          </p>
          <img
            src="../images/exp_build.png"
            alt="Points"

          </div>
          <p class="justify">
            In this case, the differences between the 1,000 and 2,000 points
            versions are not so evident, while it's very clear how both results
            differ from the population ones. While the population falling in the
            highest classes was almost not present, in this case we do have some
            buildings that are located in areas with "High" or also "Very High"
            landslide susceptibility levels. The intuitive reason for this is
            that there are some buildings in the south area of the valley near
            the lake, but they are not inhabited.

          </header>
          <p class="justify">
            In this last section some <b>final considerations</b> will be
            discussed, regardings the <b>limits</b> of the model, the
            <b>errors</b> faced and the <b>approximations</b> applied.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p class="justify">
                There are some limits and hard approximations that are
                <b>always</b>
                present in this analysis. Some of them were already stated, for
                example the limit of considering only Hazard (1) and no
                Hazard(0) area both in the <b>training and testing point</b>s
                and so in the <b>creation and validation</b> of the
                susceptibility maps.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="justify">
                Some problems were faced during the elaborations, in particular
                all those issues related to
                <b>layers projection, extention and resolution</b>. Since the
                model requires that the three components must be the same for
                each of the environmental factors, this led to some geometrical
                approximations and light distorsion, expecially because the
                layers had non homogeneous sources.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="justify">
                More detailed issues regarded the creation of the Susceptibility
                maps, which even in the final version present some
                <b>blank areas</b>. The first "blank area" issue was caused by
                the slope and the aspect layers. These layers had some "nodata"
                areas, always very flat ground areas, such as a part of the
                <i>Aprica</i> valley urbanization. In that case the error was
                corrected before running the model, appling 0 values to those
                NULL areas. The blank areas that are still visible are casued by
                the "12" <b>DUSAF</b> code, the "Productive areas", that the
                model seems to ignore.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="justify">
                Some final considerations
                <b>about the analyzed portion of territory</b> need to be
                stated. As we can evaluate even from a direct view of the
                satellite, the urbanization is all concentrated in the north
                valley of <i>Aprica</i> and this led to big variations in the
                assessment results, as already stated. In addition to that, some
                "hard" elements are present in the area, for example the ski
                slopes of <i>Aprica</i> or the small lakes as well as the
                <i>Belviso</i> one, which, depending on how the susceptibility
                level is computed, <b>may cause big variations</b>may cause big
                variations also in the validation exercise that was carried out
                after the maps creation.
