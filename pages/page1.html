            In order to make the algorithm run properly, the layers already
            presented are not enough. We need to create a set of points through
            which we define an hazard level with a precise value. To do so, two
            new datasets are used.

                The first one is directly downloaded from ISPRA: it is the "IFFI

                The second one is derived from the <i>slope</i> layer already

                70° of slope is very unlikely to generate landslides. The first
                is it not enough inclined, while the latter usually hosts
                compositions of too hard rocks.

            Thank to this assumption we are able to create the points layers. In
            particular there is the need to create two sets of points, one to
            train the model and the other one to test its result.

            In order to obtain the layer from which create points, we must
            delete the interesecting polygons between the NLZ layer and the
            landslide inventory one. These intersections are possible because we
            assumed an arbitrary and quite simple method to evaluate the hazard
            level of 0 and 1.

            Once the united later is ready, the points layer can be created. A
            random selection can be operated to mark the areas through a 30/70
            ratio. In this way, 30% will be devoted to create testing points and
            70% to create training points. A random point creator is used to
            generate the points layer, in which we will maintain a 1:1 ratio
            between 0 Hazard and 1 Hazard points.

            The final operation is to join the information of the Basic and
            Computed Data raster layers to the point layers. A sampling
            operation is carried on, so that each point get the information of
            every layer on which it spatially falls. The following screen of the
            layer attribute table shows the final result.

            The second step is to create the Susceptibility map through the R
            Model Map script in QGIS environment. In order to perform the
            computation, the script needs all the raster layers that were
            preprocessed in Step 1 and the layer of training points sampled with
            the layers information, basically everything that was showed in the
            previous section.

            The first outcome of the script is a raster layer with continue

            consistent form, the layer is reclassified to a 0 to 4 discrete
            classification. The jumps between one class and another are at 0.25,
            0.5 and 0.75.

          <p class="justify">
            In this phase the goal is to assess the exposure of the real world
            elements to landslide susceptibility just calculated. In particular
            this assessment is carried on with the population data. The idea is
            to understand how many people lives in areas with high or low level
            of landslide susceptibility. Since the vectorial ISTAT data is too
            old (2011) and also cutted with discreete geometries, a raster
            dataset is used instead, with reference at 2020. In this way is
            possible to calculate the population raster data in relation to the
            susceptibility map raster and get the overall statistics for the 4
            classes.
          </p>
          <p class="justify">
            Before doing so, we need to manipulate the population layer in order
            to prepare it for the calculation. In particular, we need to clip it
            to the area of analysis and then to resample it, as to say, make its
            resolution the most similar possible to the susceptibility map
            raster. In this way we obtain two layers with a pixel size of
            &#126;81,56 px for both of them.

          </header>
          <p class="justify">
            The last step is to process the two layers with a zonal statistic
            plugin in order to obtain the statistics of the population raster as
            a sum, in relation to the landslide susceptibility raster. The
            outcome will be a table in which for each of the 4 classes of
            susceptibility we will have the total of people living in that
            particular class of territory. While the results will be presented
            in the next page, it can be already stated that the urbanization of
            the area of analysis has definitely conditioned the outcomes. We are
            indeed in a situation in which most of the population lives in the
            Aprica Valley, which has lower susceptibility values and almost no
            one lives in the Belviso basin, which has, instead, the highest
            values.
